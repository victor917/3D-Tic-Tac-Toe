3D Tic-Tac-Toe

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Followed the tutorial from https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html to create a simple 2D Tic-Tac-Toe game using the React.js framework.

* Added my own code to create a 3D version of the game where the win conditions can be satisfied by matching three identical units in a row vertically, horizontally, or across all three boards diagonally. 

* Added "New Game" button.
